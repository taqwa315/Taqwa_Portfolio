Project 1: Twitter Airliene _US
Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) is a branch of text mining that deals with the extraction of subjective information from Twitter data. TSA aims to identify and quantify the opinions and emotions expressed by Twitter users on various topics and events. TSA is a challenging and important research area, as Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world.
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on English tweets. We used a tweet dataset that had already been annotated with sentiment labels, but for the purpose of making the analysis more comprehensive we ignored them.
